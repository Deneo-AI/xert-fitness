// ─── Paying for the class you just booked ───────────────────────────────────
// Someone books a class on the website, and nothing tells them what happens
// next. Memberships are not linked to the site yet, so there is no account to
// charge — the visitor passes are sold on their own pages, reached by QR codes
// at the front desk that a person booking from home has never seen. They end
// up booked in and unable to pay.
//
// So the sign-up asks whether they are already a member, and anyone who is not
// is offered the three ways to pay, priced from the club's own settings.
//
// A weekly membership is the fourth way, and the odd one out: it is not a
// payment this site can take. Memberships live in FitBox, so joining means
// installing FitBox and opening the club's invite there. It is listed beside
// the passes anyway — somebody deciding how to pay wants to see all four, not
// three here and one nobody mentioned.
